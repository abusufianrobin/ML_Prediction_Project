# Project 1 : SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python

This project leverages Python to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine using SONAR data from a dataset (sonar data.csv). The dataset contains information about sound wave reflections off different objects. By applying machine learning algorithms, the model is trained to differentiate between the characteristics of rocks and mines, providing an automated solution for underwater object classification. This has potential applications in mining exploration and naval safety.
